  Welcome to this site! I'm a theoretical physicist and this is my <mark>portfolio</mark>. At the top of the page, you can find various icons leading to social platforms which detail who I am -- both personally and profesionally. I would consider myself as a rather chill and an approachable person so please do not hesitate to contact me, even if it is just to say hi!

  Cheers!
